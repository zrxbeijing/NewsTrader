# NewsTrader

## Introduction
_NewsTrade_ is a Python package for news trading.
In the internet era, it is impossible to ignore the overwhelming presence of online news.
New information regarding listed companies contained in news can be digested by the market in a lightning speed.
Despite its importance, the mining of valuable information in news is still at its infancy, at least for individuals.
The access to massive news data, the processing of unstructured textual data and the modeling methodology pose great 
challenges for those who have the similar idea to exploit news to make insightful investment decisions.

This package is based on the development in NLP in recent years and aimed to apply it into daily trading by analyzing 
real-time financial news.
Many key components of this package are based on some awesome open-source packages.
However, We do not find any Python package which can fulfill the task of news trading in practice for private investors.
We try to propose a universe framework to do news trading, by gluing all necessary components together.
Note that this project is under construction and may only serve as an illustrative example.
